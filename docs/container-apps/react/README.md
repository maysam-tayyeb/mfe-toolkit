# React Container Documentation

The React container is a React 19 implementation of the MFE container specification. [Work in Progress]

## Overview

The React container provides:

- Full implementation of all required services
- React Context-based state management
- Modern React patterns and hooks
- TypeScript support throughout
- Optimized build configuration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the React container in development mode
pnpm dev:container-react

# Build for production
pnpm build:container-react

# Preview production build
cd apps/container-react && pnpm preview
```

## Architecture

### [Architecture Decisions](./architecture/decisions.md)

React-specific architectural choices:

- React Context API for state management
- Component-based MFE loaders
- Error boundary strategies
- Performance optimizations

### [State Management](./architecture/state-management.md)

How state is managed in the React container:

- Context providers structure
- Hook-based state access
- Performance considerations
- Integration with Universal State Manager

## Features

### UI Components

Built with ShadCN UI components:

- Consistent design system
- Accessibility built-in
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layouts

### Routing

React Router v6 integration:

- Nested routes for MFEs
- Route guards for authentication
- Lazy loading support
- Navigation state management

### Services Implementation

All services are implemented as React Context providers:

```typescript
// Example: Using services in an MFE
function MyMFE({ services }) {
  const { logger, eventBus, notification } = services;

  React.useEffect(() => {
    logger.info('MFE mounted');

    const unsubscribe = eventBus.on('user:login', (user) => {
      notification.success(`Welcome ${user.name}!`);
    });

    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# MFE Registry URL
VITE_MFE_REGISTRY_URL=/mfe-registry.json

# API endpoints
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Feature flags
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG=true
```

### Build Configuration

The React container uses Vite with optimized settings:

- Tree shaking enabled
- Code splitting for routes
- CSS extraction and minification
- Source map generation

## Development
